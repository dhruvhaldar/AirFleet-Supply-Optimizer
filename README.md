Optimize aerospace spare parts distribution and inventory management using advanced optimization techniques. This project implements both **Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP)** and **Integer Linear Programming (ILP)** models to solve complex aerospace logistics problems.

## üìã Features

- **Multi-period Optimization**: Plan spare parts distribution across multiple time periods
- **Cost Minimization**: Optimize total costs including transport, purchase, holding, and shortage costs
- **Multiple Transportation Modes**: Model both truck and air shipments with different cost structures
- **Real-world Constraints**: Account for truck capacity, order lead times, and repair returns
- **Visual Analytics**: Generate insightful visualizations of optimization results

## üõ†Ô∏è Test cases

### 1. Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP)
The MILP model (in `milp.ipynb`) provides a comprehensive solution for multi-period aerospace spare parts distribution with:
- Binary decision variables for order placement
- Continuous variables for inventory and shipments
- Real-world constraints including capacity and lead times
- Detailed cost analysis and visualization

### 2. Integer Linear Programming (ILP)
The ILP model (in `ilp.ipynb`) offers an alternative approach with:
- Pure integer programming formulation
- Simplified constraints for specific use cases
- Performance-optimized for certain problem sizes

### 3. Linear Quadratic Integral (LQI) Controller

## üì¶ Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- PyPy (recommended for better performance)
- Jupyter Notebook (for viewing and running the notebooks)
- Required Python packages (see `requirements.txt`):
  - PuLP (for optimization)
  - NumPy (for numerical operations)
  - Matplotlib (for visualization)
  - Pandas (for data manipulation)

## üöÄ Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/dhruvhaldar/AirFleet-Supply-Optimizer.git
   cd AirFleet-Supply-Optimizer
   ```

2. **Set up a virtual environment**
   
   For Windows:
   ```
   python -m venv my-pypy-venv
   my-pypy-venv\Scripts\activate
   ```
   
   For Linux/macOS:
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv my-pypy-venv
   source my-pypy-venv/bin/activate
   ```

3. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Usage

### Running the MILP Model
1. Open `milp.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook
2. Run all cells to execute the optimization
3. Review the results and visualizations

### Running the ILP Model
1. Open `ilp.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook
2. Run all cells to execute the optimization
3. Analyze the results and compare with MILP approach

## üìä Model Parameters

### Input Data
- **Bases**: Storage locations (e.g., Delhi, Mumbai, Bengaluru)
- **Stations**: Demand points (e.g., Kolkata, Hyderabad, Chennai)
- **Parts**: Different types of spare parts
- **Periods**: Planning time periods

### Cost Components
- Transportation costs (truck and air)
- Purchase costs
- Holding costs
- Shortage costs
- Fixed ordering costs

## üìà Results

The optimization provides:
- Optimal order quantities for each base and period
- Shipment schedules (truck and air)
- Inventory levels over time
- Total cost breakdown
- Performance metrics
