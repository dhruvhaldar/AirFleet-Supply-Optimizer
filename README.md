# AirFleet Supply Optimizer (AFSO)

A Python-based optimization tool for managing and optimizing air fleet supply chains. This tool helps in making data-driven decisions for fleet management, route optimization, and resource allocation in aviation logistics.

## Features

- Fleet capacity optimization
- Route planning and optimization
- Fuel consumption analysis
- Cost estimation and minimization
- Performance metrics and reporting

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- PyPy (recommended for better performance)
- pip (Python package manager)

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/dhruvhaldar/AirFleet-Supply-Optimizer--AFSO-.git
   cd AirFleet-Supply-Optimizer--AFSO-
   ```

2. **Set up a virtual environment**
   
   For Windows:
   ```
   python -m venv my-pypy-venv
   my-pypy-venv\Scripts\activate
   ```
   
   For Linux/macOS:
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv my-pypy-venv
   source my-pypy-venv/bin/activate
   ```

3. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

1. **Configure your input files**
   - Prepare your fleet data in the required format
   - Update the configuration files as needed

2. **Run the optimization**
   ```bash
   python transport_model.py
   ```

3. **View results**
   - Check the output directory for generated reports
   - Analyze the optimization results
