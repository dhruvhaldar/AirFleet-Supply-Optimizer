    "\n",
    "The **Aerospace Spare Parts Optimization Model** is a **Multi-Period MILP** designed to optimize the distribution and inventory management of spare parts in an aerospace logistics network.  \n",

    "The model minimizes **total costs** (transportation, purchasing, holding, shortage, and fixed ordering costs), while ensuring demand satisfaction across multiple stations and managing inventory at bases. It incorporates real-world complexities such as truck capacity constraints, optional air shipments, repair returns, and order lead times.\n",
